            <br>
{{! TODO deal with millions}}
            <p>The existing blockchain economy has market capitalization of {{readableN1 cap_btc_mln}} M
               <!-- Calculate precise total cap in BTC --> bitcoins or {{readableN2 cap_usd_bln}} B
               <!-- Calculate precise total cap in USD --> US dollars. It is
                a result of the evaluation of {{cap.autonomous}} <!-- Calculate total DAOs -->
                decentralized systems and of {{cap.dependent}} <!-- Calculate total DAppss -->
                decentralized applications that are built upon them. We call this
                new blockchain economy cybernomics. This economy is permissionless, global,
                tax-free, and could be programmed to perform autonomously
                and at low costs any operations. Any type of values could be created in it, any kind
                of organizations could be programmed. The traditional world economy
                has more than 1B business entities. The blockchain technology
                could be easily adopted by majority of them in 10 years
                as there is no need for special hardware, and adoption costs are low.
                The low-level similar to public infrastructure blockchain systems such as
                <a href="https://cyber.fund/system/Ethereum" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>,
                <a href="https://cyber.fund/system/BitShares" target="_blank">BitShares</a>
                and <a href="https://cyber.fund/system/Factom" target="_blank">Factom</a> have been launched recently.
                <a href="https://cyber.fund/system/MaidSafeCoin" target="_blank">SAFE Network</a>
                is coming. <a href="http://cybertalks.org/t/exausted-list-of-permissioned-blockchain-solutions/330" target="_blank">Private blockhains</a> are to take off.</p>

            <p>In 3 years we expect an explosive interest to decentralized
                systems and decentralized applications from developers and
                investors. This will open doors to huge investment opportunities that have never existed before. We think that now a market share of blockchain investment
                services is roughly 1/200 of cybernomics that is {{readableN0 cap_btc_div_200k}}k
                <!-- Calculate total Cap in BTC / 200 and round to thousands-->
                bitcoins. However, there is a huge growth potential.
                Today there is no entities that focus on professional
                services in this niche. Meanwhile, we think that in the future
                all existing public companies that are listed on
                traditional exchanges and have a cap of roughly $100T (yeah, we like huge sums) will be re-engineered using
                blockchains. That is approximately $500B niche of investment services that we want to serve and that doesn’t
                exist yet. Today cyber•Fund cap is unknown but if we reach our goal that will be not more {{nicheShare}}
                <!-- Current share in niche --> of the existing niche. The proportion reflects a potential for our growth in case of doing what we like — providing superior services to our users — in the best and most efficient manner.</p>

            <p>cyber•Fund founders have unique experience in blockchain
                investments. Two of us as many of you were early bitcoin miners in 2011. In 2013
                we decided to invest our bitcoins into promising blockchain
                projects. Since then we created first and unique private crypto-equity
                funds — <a href="https://cyber.fund/@satoshi_fund" target="_blank">Satoshi•Fund
                    2013</a> and <a href="https://cyber.fund/@satoshi_fund_14" target="_blank">Satoshi•Fund
                    2014</a>. This year we have been working on cyber•Fund, the investment
                service, that are designed and built to solve problems of those who invested in cryptoassets, blockchain systems and applications.</p>

            <p>In the next 6 months we are going to focus on lean, open source development of
                the tools for blockchain developers as we want to give investors
                in cryptoassets the most relevant, and high quality data that
                will enable them to make smart investment decisions.
                We will deliver accurate, real-time and exhausted data and provide
                individual  recommendations. If our assumptions prove viable we
                will focus on developing a decentralized investment protocol on top of
                the existing service and community. It will be time for us
                to make a public offering.</p>

            <p>Eventually we are dreaming of backing all analytical data by advanced machine
                intelligence that will use a decentralized computational
                network which will maximize earnings for you.</p>

            <br>

            <h5>Are CFUNDs just another cryptocurrency?</h5>

            <p>Definitely not. cyber•Fund is a private blockchain entity that
                operates under domain cyber.fund. There are shareholders rights
                assigned to those who owns tokens specified in the Genesis
                Agreement. Please, read this 1-page document carefully before
                investing.</p>
            <h5>How can I check that you don't cheat on me with a revenue?</h5>

            <p>Simple enough! We call it proof-of-revenue mechanism. All
                revenue addresses will be embedded in site’s code. All code is
                open source. <a href="https://github.com/cyberFund"
                             target="_blank">Check it</a>. So you can be sure
                that any time somebody sends us some bitcoins for services,
                money will not pass by. They just simply could not.</p>
            <h5>Is your entity centralized?</h5>

            <p>Kind of. Majority of tokens are under control of the co-founders.
                Like in traditional startups. But tokens are accounted on
                Bitcoin blockchain using Open Assets protocol. Our code is
                open source.</p>
            <p>The truth is that the domain-based businesses cannot be
                decentralized as domain names are managed centrally by ICANN, and
                a business of any internet company is bound to a domain. It is a
                brand, a source of organic traffic, etc. A lot of operations we do
                can’t be decentralized. However, once we will figure out  — with
                help of Ethereum, IPFS, SAFE Network, etc. — how to decentralized
                them we will make the next step! And you will be with us!</p>
            <h5>But why do you call your service decentralized?</h5>

            <p>We don't put our hands on your money. And we want to attract
                users who will be ready to prove to each other that they own funds
                and addresses. This approach will allow us to gather data on
                cryptoinvestments on cyberFund's platform without dependence on
                any technology except for public/private key cryptography. So our
                service will be able to help users with cryptoinvestments in a
                truly decentralized fashion, but with efficiency that is
                unachievable for any centralized funds or entities that exist
                today. You can think of cyber•Fund as fund of funds. If cyber.fund
                domain one day disappears all investors will stay with the money
                that they own. Cool! Decentralized, doesn’t it?</p>
            <h5>Why are you selling so few?</h5>

            <p>Because at this point of time we don’t want to sell more than 3%
                of our equity. We already put a lot of efforts and resources in
                this project and were self-funded for some time. We are quite
                lean, and our burn rate is modest, but we need to test revenue
                hypothesis and thus prove that we could be profitable in the
                long run. So, we don’t want to sell more as we want to earn our
                own fair share of profits and we want our shareholders to
                understand that we are here to stay and do business. The best
                practice for startups in so called pre-seed stage is to find
                business angels, the guys who give money needed to reach
                product/market fit. So by this placement we are putting a
                traditional approach on a new blockchain crowdfunding rails.
                We want to get money from those who are interested in our
                product as users, partners, and investors. We believe that you
                guys could help us to reach product/market fit earlier than any
                angel from a Silicon Valley.</p>
            <h5>Why is a minimal investment 1 BTC?</h5>

            <p>We don’t start this campaign just for money. As mentioned before
                we want to attract people who are seriously interested in
                cyber•Fund project.</p>
            <h5>When will CFUNDs be tradable?</h5>

            <p>We are not going to do anything to put CFUND on exchange until
                much later when we will do public offering mentioned above.
                Remember, that after placement cyber•Fund remains private.
                However, we cannot stop you from trading CFUNDs if you want.</p>
            <h5>How long will a private phase last?</h5>

            <p>We don’t know. To make a successful public offering we need at
                least 2k+ happy users. Moreover, we need to deliver a prototype
                of the decentralized investment platform that we want to create
                finally. According to our estimates, a year from now is a
                reasonable time-frame.</p>
